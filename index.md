# Phone-Controlled Robotic Arm
The robotic arm is an amazing introduction to the world of robotics and engineering. I learned both important engineering skills and important coding skills to complete this project.<!-- You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails! -->

I had many, many challenges for this milestone. The code provided to control the arm with the joysticks did not work, even after spending many hours trying to debug it. I had several errors preventing the program from even starting, such as exit status 1 and my Arduino nano board not responding. I found out one of the servos broke too, probably from the program having the arm spin around and pulling the wire too hard. I decided to completely redo my code for the joystsicks to control the arm. My code also had many bugs I had to work on, such as unoptimized code, malfunctioning joystick inputs. My code determining which direction the servos should move could not work as well. I had many difficulties reaching this milestone, but I am glad I learned a lot from it.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was contructing the frame of the arm. I installed the Arduino Nano board and the base of the arm to the base board. I attached all 4 servos to the chasis, the 2 joints, and the claw. The building process was rocky at first. I was missing a bag of screws that were vital for many of the joints, but luckily Bluestamp had the same size screw. I also accidentally broke a piece while trying to insert a bearing into one of the parts of the arm, but I was able to fix it with tape after a couple of tries. Despite all the inconveniences, this milestone went relatively smooth.

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.

# Starter Project

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9XJgiP5lbAM?si=RNG3RObgSUzBcW8B" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

My starter project was the calculator. This project both challenged me and made me learn a lot about enginnering. Even though I knew practically nothing about engineering, I learned skills such as soldering, desoldering, and using the multimeter to make the calculator. I had to solder on the LED display, all the button sensors, the battery slot, and the USB port. I struggled on what to do because there were no instructions. For example, the frame of the calculator could not fit the hardware, so I had to rearrange the frame to fit it. Overall, this project was an important step to a more complex project. Next, I will be starting my main project, the Phone-Controlled Robotic Arm.
